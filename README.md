# Titanic Challenge

This repository is my solution for the famous Titanic Survival Prediction from Kaggle (<https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic>).

## Kaggle Result

This approach yields a public score of 0.81578 which puts me in rank 332 on the leaderboard (24.07.2024).

This competition has a two-month rolling leaderboard. Once a submission is more than two months old, it is automatically invalidated and no longer counts towards the leaderboard.
